						<h2>Her Story</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I saw Stefan in the lunch hall before we met and every time I saw him, I heard a persistent voice in my mind saying "Go and sit next to him". We were at work and I was super shy and always had an excuse not to go over and say hello. So, one day, the lunch hall was super busy. As I walked in, searching for a table, he was sitting right there, with the only available seats. My heart literally jumped out of my chest and then back in again. Then a voice said, "Girl, you've got this". I built up enough courage and asked politely if the seat was free and sat down. I tried not to look at him because I was nervous and immediately, I started thinking "What I should I say?". "No, you've done enough. He needs to say something". Eventually, he said "Hello" and we started to get to know each other. Since that day, our connection grew closer. We found out we had so much in common - faith in God, we're Jamaican, we both love the same music, food, and love traveling. In January 2018, we took our first trip to Jamaica together and we loved it so much we went back again. On 28.09.2019, we got engaged! Shortly after, it was the Covid-19 Pandemic and we had to postpone our wedding. Finally, on 21st July 2021, we will be celebrating our marriage! We're so excited to celebrate this next chapter with you!</p>

						<h2>His Story</h2>
					</header>
					<p>When I saw Shanique for the first time she honestly took my breath away. She sat at my table in the lunch hall at work. One of the first things that came to my mind when I saw her was that she looked so scrumptious and gorgeous that she shocked me with her beauty. I thought to God that He was playing with my emotions, that he would just drop an angel right in front of me. I remember thinking 'This must be the wife'. So I said, 'Hello, what's your name?' She had the biggest shy grin on her face, she looked up cautiously and answered. We spent our whole lunchtime together, talking and laughing. We learned a lot about each other over lunch, she had so many desirable characteristics and ways about her I was attracted to. Along with a personality that complemented mine. The moment I found out we were both Jamaican the wife thoughts I had earlier was justified. A woman of wife material, and so my pursuit continued.</p>
